### What is Angular, and how is it different from other JavaScript frameworks?

Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end framework developed by Google for building SPAs (Single Page Applications). Unlike libraries like React, Angular provides a complete framework with built-in dependency injection, routing, and HTTP client support.

---------------------------------------------
### Components 

*  Fundamental building block of the application, acting as a view with its own logic and data, dictating how a specific part of the app looks and behaves.

---------------------------------------------
### Selector & template

*  The selector identifies a component for use in a template, instructing Angular to instantiate the component whenever it encounters the matching tag or attribute. 
*  The template defines the HTML structure and content of that component's view.

---------------------------------------------
### Modules 

* Module is nan entity that acts as container to group related components, directives, pipes and services
* Used for better organization and mgmt of code 
* Diff types of modules - RootModule (App Module), Feature Module, shared module, core modules and routing modules

### How Angular app is bootstrapped? / Important files - index.html, app-root selector & main.ts file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fa053c6-cc4b-4d43-a19a-9252e958cc72)

 • project.json => specifies dependencies and their version

 • For Angular projects v17 or later where Standalone components are supported, the main.ts will look like this

---------------------------------------------
### BootStrap module & BootStrap component

* Now its obselete after the introduction of Standalones.
* BOOT-STRAP MODULE/COMPONENT => The first modeule/Component that is launched by Angular app at start up. (AppModule/AppComponent)
* main.ts => Configures BootStrap module and bootstrap module configures bootstrap component
    
---------------------------------------------
### Data Binding - Diff Types (String Interpolation, Property Binding, Event Binding, 2-Way Binding)
