## OOPS

[1. Abstract Class vs Interface](#1.-abstract-class-vs-interface)

[2. Immutable vs Mutable / string vs StringBuilder](#2.-immutable-vs-mutable-/-string-vs-StringBuilder)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Abstract Class vs Interface
* Abstract class are half cooked classes having atleast 1 or more method bodies but Interface is a contract (Blueprint) having method declarations only and it cannot have any method definition.
* A class as a child can inherit only from one abstract class as a base but it can inherit multiple intefaces
* Access specifiers can be used in Abstract class but all method declarations are public in interface.
* Abstract classs can have ctor while interfaces does not.
  
_* Both Abstract class and interface cannot be instantiated (i.e cannot create objects)_

### 2. Immutable vs Mutable / string vs StringBuilder

Immutable = whose state CAN NOT Be changed e.g string class
Mutable = can be changed e.g. StringBuilder class

* When we modify the value of a string object, new memory is allowcated for new value and previous memory is released
* When multiple update operations are required on string then choose StringBuilder for better performance

### 3. Value vs Reference type

* A variable of a value type contains an instance of the type. This differs from a variable of a reference type, which contains a reference to an instance of the type.
* Value types are allocated on the stack only when used directly inside methods.

### 4. Stack vs Heap

### 5. Boxing/Unboxing

### 6. Is string value type or ref?

string is ref type and its managed by GC

### 7. structs in C#

* structs are by default **value type.** So
  * passed by value while passed as arg to method or returning method results.
  * are MANAGED Code and its memory managed by GC
  * struct objects on which memory ?  STACK
  * struct support inheritance ?   NO
