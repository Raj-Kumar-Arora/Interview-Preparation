**Abstract Class vs Interface**
* Abstract class are half cooked classes having atleast 1 or more method bodies but Interface is a contract (Blueprint) having method declarations only and it cannot have any method definition.
* A class as a child can inherit only from one abstract class as a base but it can inherit multiple intefaces
* Access specifiers can be used in Abstract class but all method declarations are public in interface.
* Abstract classs can have ctor while interfaces does not.
* ---
* Both Abstract class and interface cannot be instantiated (i.e cannot create objects)
*
