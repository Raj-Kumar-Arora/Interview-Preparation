[1. Abstract Class vs Interface](#1.-abstract-class-vs-interface)

[2. Immutable vs Mutable / String vs String Builder](#2.-immutable-vs-mutable-/-string-vs-string-Builder)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Abstract Class vs Interface
* Abstract class are half cooked classes having atleast 1 or more method bodies but Interface is a contract (Blueprint) having method declarations only and it cannot have any method definition.
* A class as a child can inherit only from one abstract class as a base but it can inherit multiple intefaces
* Access specifiers can be used in Abstract class but all method declarations are public in interface.
* Abstract classs can have ctor while interfaces does not.
  
_* Both Abstract class and interface cannot be instantiated (i.e cannot create objects)_

### 2. Immutable vs Mutable / String vs String Builder

Immutable = whose state CAN NOT Be changed e.g String class
Mutable = can be changed e.g. StringBuilder class

* When we modify the value of a string object, new memory is allowcated for new value and previous memory is released
* When multiple update operations are required on string then choose StringBuilder for better performance
