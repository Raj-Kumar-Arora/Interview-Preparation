[1. Abstract Class vs Interface](#1.-abstract-class-vs-interface)

[2. Immutable vs Mutable / string vs StringBuilder](#2.-immutable-vs-mutable-/-string-vs-StringBuilder)


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Abstract Class vs Interface
* Abstract class are half cooked classes having atleast 1 or more method bodies but Interface is a contract (Blueprint) having method declarations only and it cannot have any method definition.
* A class as a child can inherit only from one abstract class as a base but it can inherit multiple intefaces
* Access specifiers can be used in Abstract class but all method declarations are public in interface.
* Abstract classs can have ctor while interfaces does not.
  
_* Both Abstract class and interface cannot be instantiated (i.e cannot create objects)_

### 2. Immutable vs Mutable / string vs StringBuilder
Immutable = whose state CAN NOT Be changed after creation e.g value types, string class (exception)
Mutable = can be changed after creation e.g. StringBuilder class

* When we modify the value of a string object, new memory is allowcated for new value and previous memory is released
* When multiple update operations are required on string then choose StringBuilder for better performance

### 3. Value vs Reference type
* A variable of a value type contains an instance of the type. This differs from a variable of a reference type, which contains a reference to an instance of the type.
* Value types are allocated on the stack only when used directly inside methods.
* Value types are immutable

### 4. Stack vs Heap

### 5. Boxing/Unboxing
  * Boxing = value type -> type object conversion

    e.g.   ```java
           int i = 123;
           object o = i;     //BOXING 
          ```
            
  * Unboxing = object type -> value type 
    e.g.  int i = (int)o;  //UNBOXING

    ```java
    int i = 123;
    object o = i;     //BOXING 
    ```

  * Both boxing and unboxing cause a performance hit

### 6. Is string value type or ref?
* string is ref type and its managed by GC
* string is a reference type even though it has most of the characteristics of a value type such as being immutable

### 7. unmanaged types
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/unmanaged-types
  - int - enum - tuple  => YES
  - structs  => NO
 
### 8. enums
  * enums are value types
  * enums are unmanaged types so its memory NOT managed by GC
  * underlying int type
  * support inheritance ?   NO

### 9. structs in C#
  * structs are by default **value type.** So
    * passed by value while passed as arg to method or returning method results.
    * are MANAGED Code and its memory managed by GC
    * struct objects on which memory ?  STACK
  * struct support inheritance ?   NO

### 10. Managed code

### 11. Nullable types

### 12. ref vs out keyword

### 16. Garbage Collection, Dispose, GC.SuppressFinalize, using block
  https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/garbage-collection-dispose-vs-finalize-and-idisposable-pattern/
 
  Garbage collector - how it works
  Idisposable
        -  can we call destructor/finallizer
        -  Can we call dispose 
        -  suppress finaller keyword ?
        
    • Dispose vs finalizer
    • using block
    IDisposable
    why finaliser /dispose
    Using block 
    • GC . GC.SuppressFinalize
    • GC.KeepAlive property
    • Can objects be moved from Gen0 to Gen2 directly if this is large size object

### 17. Func vs Action vs Predicate 

### 18.tuple
• used to return multiple data values.    From <https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/tuples-in-c-sharp/> 
 
• provides concise syntax to group multiple data elements in a lightweight data structure. 
From <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples> 

### 19. ref vs out
