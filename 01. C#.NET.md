---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 1. Abstract Class vs Interface
* Abstract class are half cooked classes having atleast 1 or more method bodies but Interface is a contract (Blueprint) having method declarations only and it cannot have any method definition.
* A class as a child can inherit only from one abstract class as a base but it can inherit multiple intefaces
* Access specifiers can be used in Abstract class but all method declarations are public in interface.
* Abstract classs can have ctor while interfaces does not.
  
_* Both Abstract class and interface cannot be instantiated (i.e cannot create objects)_

### 2. Immutable vs Mutable / string vs StringBuilder
Immutable = whose state CAN NOT Be changed after creation e.g value types, string class (exception)
Mutable = can be changed after creation e.g. StringBuilder class

* When we modify the value of a string object, new memory is allowcated for new value and previous memory is released
* When multiple update operations are required on string then choose StringBuilder for better performance

### 3. Value vs Reference type
* A variable of a value type contains an instance of the type. This differs from a variable of a reference type, which contains a reference to an instance of the type.
* Value types are allocated on the stack only when used directly inside methods.
* Value types are immutable

### 4. Stack vs Heap

### 5. Boxing/Unboxing
  * Boxing = value type -> type object conversion
    ```.net
    int i = 123;
    object o = i;     //BOXING 
    ```
          
  * Unboxing = object type -> value type
    ```java
    int i = (int)o;  //UNBOXING
    ```
    
  * Both boxing and unboxing cause a performance hit

### 6. Is string value type or ref?
* string is ref type and its managed by GC
* string is a reference type even though it has most of the characteristics of a value type such as being immutable

### 7. unmanaged types
  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/unmanaged-types
  - int - enum - tuple  => YES
  - structs  => NO
 
### 8. enums
  * enums are value types
  * enums are unmanaged types so its memory NOT managed by GC
  * underlying int type
  * support inheritance ?   NO

### 9. structs in C#
  * structs are by default **value type.** So
    * passed by value while passed as arg to method or returning method results.
    * are MANAGED Code and its memory managed by GC
    * struct objects on which memory ?  STACK
  * struct support inheritance ?   NO

### 10. Managed code
*  https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code

*  **MANAGED CODE **
    *  Code whose execution is managed by Common Language Runtime or CLR
    *  The CLR is in charge of taking the managed code, compiling it into machine code and then executing it.
    *  The CLR provides several important services such as automatic memory management, security boundaries, and type safety.
      
    *  Examples of unmanaged code - File Handles, Network connection objects
       C/C++ programs = "unmanaged code" binary that the operating system (OS) loads into memory and starts.
    *  C# code = Managed code => Compling it returns  Intermediate Language code => CLR converts it into Machine code/binary executables.       

### 11. Nullable types / ? vs ?? vs Ternary operator (? :)

|                      |  ??   Returns the value of its left-hand operand if it isn't null; **otherwise**,                           |

### 16. Garbage Collection, Dispose Pattern, GC.SuppressFinalize, using block, LOH (Large object heap)
  https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/garbage-collection-dispose-vs-finalize-and-idisposable-pattern/
 
  Garbage collector - how it works
  Idisposable
        -  can we call destructor/finallizer
        -  Can we call dispose 
        -  suppress finaller keyword ?
        
    • Dispose vs finalizer
    • using block
    IDisposable
    why finaliser /dispose
    Using block 
    • GC . GC.SuppressFinalize
    • GC.KeepAlive property
    • Can objects be moved from Gen0 to Gen2 directly if this is large size object

### 17. Func vs Action vs Predicate

### 18. tuple
• used to return multiple data values.    From <https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/tuples-in-c-sharp/> 
 
• provides concise syntax to group multiple data elements in a lightweight data structure.

### 21. Memory leaks / Have you worked with any scenarios with Memory issues
* Yes, Keysight applications which UI extensive and logging data from instruments for many days or even month and displaying data for a vast range based on filter like AUTO SCALE or specific time range.
* Used memory profiler to diagnose the memory usage over time and performance

*  Refer this article for various other scenarios
