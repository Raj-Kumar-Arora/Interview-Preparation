### 1.1 Monolithic Architecture

| Intro  | A monolithic architecture is a software architectural style in which a large application is built as a single, monolithic unit. In a monolithic architecture, all components of the application are tightly coupled and interdependent, and are typically deployed together as a single unit. |
| ADV. | Some advantages of monolithic architecture include simplicity, ease of development and deployment, and better performance and reliability for small applications. That means, monolithic architecture can be an attractive option for small-scale or simple applications, where the benefits of a more complex architecture may not be necessary. |
| Dis-ADV. | Some disadvantages of monolithic architecture include reduced flexibility and scalability, increased complexity and coordination overhead with overtime, and difficulty in managing and maintaining a large number of components. As applications become larger and more complex, these disadvantages can become more significant, making a monolithic architecture less attractive. |

#### 1.1.1  INTRODUCTION
A monolithic architecture is a software architectural style in which a large application is built as a single, monolithic unit. In a monolithic architecture, all components of the application are tightly coupled and interdependent, and are typically deployed together as a single unit.

#### 1.1.2  ADV
* Simplicity
* Ease of development and deployment
* Better performance
* Bettter reliability
* Suitable for small-sclar / simple app
  
#### 1.1.2  DIS-ADV
*  Reduced flexibility
*  Reduced scability
*  Increase complexity
*  Difficult to manage large no of compoenents as code base grow with time

| INTRODUCTION | 
| A monolithic architecture is a software architectural style in which a large application is built as a single, monolithic unit. In a monolithic architecture, all components of the application are tightly coupled and interdependent, and are typically deployed together as a single unit. |
| ADV | 
| * Simplicity  <br/> * Ease of development and deployment   <br/> * Better performance  <br/> * Bettter reliability  <br/> * Suitable for small-sclar / simple app | 
| DIS-ADV |
| *  Reduced flexibility <br/> *  Reduced scability  <br/> *  Increase complexity  <br/> *  Difficult to manage large no of compoenents as code base grow with time |
| WHEN TO USE | 
| •  For organizations that are looking to quickly develop and deploy an application, or that have limited resources and expertise in developing and maintaining a microservices-based architecture.  </br/> 
  •  Where the benefits of a more complex architecture may not be necessary.  |
| Why can code become too complex over time in a Monolithic Architecture ? |
| *  The existing codebase is large and difficult to manage, as it contains all of the components and dependencies of the application in a single codebase.  </br/> 
  *  Monolithic architecture typically does not provide good support for modularity, which is the ability to easily isolate and change individual components of the application without affecting the rest of the system. </br>
  *  Tightly coupled and interdependent components, which can make it difficult to make changes to one part of the code without affecting other parts of the codebase. |
  
---------------------------------------------
### 1.2 Microservices Architecture

| |
|- |
| What are Microservices ? | 
| *  Microservices are a software architectural style in which a large application is built as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services. </br>  *  Each microservice is a separate unit of functionality, typically with its own codebase and database, that communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs. |
|  What is a Microservices Architecture ? |    
| *  In a microservices architecture, a single application is built as a suite of independent, modular components that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. </br>   *  This allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the development and deployment of applications.|
| Benefits of using Microservices |
| *  Improved scalability, flexibility, and resilience, faster deployment and release cycles, and better support for continuous delivery and deployment. </br>   *  Additionally, microservices can make it easier to manage and maintain a large number of components, which is often a challenge in a monolithic architecture. |
| Drawbacks of using Microservices |
| *  Increased complexity.  | 
| *  Due to lots of services, it needs more advanced deployment and management requirements. Also it can lead the potential for increased communication and coordination overhead. |
| How do Microservices compare to Monolithic Architecture ? |

| Main difference between Monolithic and Microservices Architectures |
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03a42ede-cf0f-448c-9054-f415a89c4807) |
| Main characteristics of microservices |
| *  Modularity, independence, interoperability, and scalability. |
| *  In a microservices architecture, each microservice is designed to be a separate, independently deployable unit of functionality, with its own codebase and database. This modularity allows each microservice to be changed or updated without affecting the rest of the system. |
