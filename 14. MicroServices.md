| Intro  | A monolithic architecture is a software architectural style in which a large application is built as a single, monolithic unit. In a monolithic architecture, all components of the application are tightly coupled and interdependent, and are typically deployed together as a single unit. |
| ADV. | Some advantages of monolithic architecture include simplicity, ease of development and deployment, and better performance and reliability for small applications. That means, monolithic architecture can be an attractive option for small-scale or simple applications, where the benefits of a more complex architecture may not be necessary. |
| Dis-ADV. | Some disadvantages of monolithic architecture include reduced flexibility and scalability, increased complexity and coordination overhead with overtime, and difficulty in managing and maintaining a large number of components. As applications become larger and more complex, these disadvantages can become more significant, making a monolithic architecture less attractive. |

| **INTRODUCTION** | 
| A monolithic architecture is a software architectural style in which a large application is built as a single, monolithic unit. In a monolithic architecture, all components of the application are tightly coupled and interdependent, and are typically deployed together as a single unit. |
| **ADV** | 
| * Simplicity  <br/> * Ease of development and deployment   <br/> * Better performance  <br/> * Bettter reliability  <br/> * Suitable for small-sclar / simple app | 
| **DIS-ADV** |
| *  Reduced flexibility <br/> *  Reduced scability  <br/> *  Increase complexity  <br/> *  Difficult to manage large no of compoenents as code base grow with time |
| **WHEN TO USE** | 
| •  For organizations that are looking to quickly develop and deploy an application, or that have limited resources and expertise in developing and maintaining a microservices-based architecture.  </br/> 
  •  Where the benefits of a more complex architecture may not be necessary.  |
| **Why can code become too complex over time in a Monolithic Architecture ?** |
| *  The existing codebase is large and difficult to manage, as it contains all of the components and dependencies of the application in a single codebase.  </br/> |
|  *  Monolithic architecture typically does not provide good support for modularity, which is the ability to easily isolate and change individual components of the application without affecting the rest of the system. </br> |
|  *  Tightly coupled and interdependent components, which can make it difficult to make changes to one part of the code without affecting other parts of the codebase. |

### 1.2 Microservices Architecture
<details>
  <Summary> DETAILS </Summary>
  
| |
|- |
| **What are Microservices ?**| 
| *  Microservices are a software architectural style in which a large application is built as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular services. </br>  *  Each microservice is a separate unit of functionality, typically with its own codebase and database, that communicates with other microservices through well-defined APIs. |
| **What is a Microservices Architecture ?**|    
| *  In a microservices architecture, a single application is built as a suite of independent, modular components that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. </br>   *  This allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the development and deployment of applications.|
| **Benefits of using Microservices** |
| *  Improved scalability, flexibility, and resilience, faster deployment and release cycles, and better support for continuous delivery and deployment. </br>   *  Additionally, microservices can make it easier to manage and maintain a large number of components, which is often a challenge in a monolithic architecture. |
| **Drawbacks of using Microservices** |
| *  Increased complexity.  | 
| *  Due to lots of services, it needs more advanced deployment and management requirements. Also it can lead the potential for increased communication and coordination overhead. |
| **How do Microservices compare to Monolithic Architecture ?**|

| **Main characteristics of microservices** |
| *  Modularity, independence, interoperability, and scalability. |

### 2. Microservices Communications 

<details>
  <summary> DETAILS </summary>
</details>

| | 
| - |
| **In a monolithic architecture, how do the different components of the application communicate with each other ?** |
| In a monolithic architecture, the different components of the application are tightly coupled and communicate with each other directly, often using in-memory calls. This can make the architecture inflexible and difficult to scale. |
| **In a microservices-based architecture, how do the different components of the application communicate with each other ?**|
| In a microservices-based architecture, the different components of the application are organized into independent, self-contained microservices that communicate with each other using APIs. This allows for more modular and flexible communication between the different components of the application. |
| **Microservices Communications types**|
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1435e6b0-89c6-4f87-a1bc-bfa270239bb3) |
| **What are the best practices of Communication in Microservices ?** |
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a567de92-371f-4cec-8c83-66b525d6dc56) |
| **What is the role of OpenAPI and Swagger in the development of microservices ?** |
| OpenAPI and Swagger are popular standards and tools for defining, documenting, and validating the APIs exposed by microservices. These tools make it easier for developers to understand and use the APIs exposed by microservices, which can help to improve the reliability, maintainability, and interoperability of a microservices-based application. |
| **What is a common approach for implementing inter-service communication in microservices ?** |
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fa8254c-bce0-4085-9503-52c4fd12c4ee) |
| RESTFul APIs provide a simple and standardized way for the microservices to exchange data, making them a common choice for implementing inter-service communication in microservices. By exposing the APIs as endpoints, it is possible for the microservices to communicate with each other using a common protocol, such as HTTP, which is widely supported and well understood.|
| **Why is it important to create well-defined APIs for inter-service communication in microservices ?**|
| By defining the interfaces between the microservices using well-defined APIs, it is possible to ensure that the microservices can communicate with each other in a predictable and reliable way. This makes it easier for developers to integrate the microservices into the application, and helps to ensure that the communication between the microservices is efficient and effective.|
| **What is the advantage of exposing the APIs as endpoints in microservices ?**|
| ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a46d7b09-b83d-40c8-88e7-acd737be74fd) |
| **What is synchronous communication in microservices ?**|
| In synchronous communication is a type of communication where the calling service waits for a response from the called service before continuing.|
| **What are the benefits of using synchronous communication in microservices ?** |
| Synchronous communication in microservices provide to simplifies the implementation of the communication logic. |
| **What are the drawbacks of using synchronous communication in microservices ?**|
| Synchronous communications are become bottlenecks when latency and wait times increased so much.|
| **What is asynchronous communication in microservices ?** |
| Asynchronous communication in microservices has lots of benefit but the main advantage is decoupling services and continue their operation without any wait time.|
| **Benefits of using asynchronous communication ** |

| **How can we define asynchronous communication in microservices ?** |
|   Asynchronous communication in microservices communicates on messaging and queues to provide decouple services and not to be available at the same time that is also increase scalability.   |

|  Event-driven communication in microservices is a type of communication in which services send and receive messages in response to events that occur within the system. This allows the services to communicate with each other without the need for them to be actively available at the same time, providing loose coupling and decoupling between the services.    |
