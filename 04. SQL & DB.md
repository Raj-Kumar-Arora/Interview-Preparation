### 1. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

#### 1.1 Indexes / Clustered VS Non-Clustered Indexes
| | |
|-|-|
| **Index purpose** | To speed-up query process resulting in high performance. |
| | Without the index, a complete table scan would have to be performed in order to locate the row, which can have a significant effect on performance.  |
| | They are similar to textbook indexes. In textbooks, if you need to go to a particular chapter, you go to the index, find the page number of the chapter and go directly to that page. Without indexes, the process of finding your desired chapter would have been very slow. 
| **Clustered Indexe** | A clustered index defines the order in which data is physically stored in a table. Table data can be sorted in only way, therefore, there can be only one clustered index per table. |
| **Composite Indexe** |  An index that is created on more than one column is called “composite index”. |
| **Custom Clustered Index** | You can create your own custom index as well the default clustered index. To create a new clustered index on a table you first have to delete the previous index. |
| **Non-Clustered Indexe** | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0eb4fa3b-83f1-48fb-be01-df53279326c1) |
| **Clustered VS Non-Clustered Indexes** | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f352322-f8dd-4b5c-b2fe-362bc11944cd) |
| **Should we have index on all columns of table** | NO, performance will be degraded |
| **Cons of having indexes** | On every add, insert, delete operation of a record, the indexes are refreshed. So more indexes mean more performance penalty whenever a new row or column is added |
| REF | https://www.sqlshack.com/what-is-the-difference-between-clustered-and-non-clustered-indexes-in-sql-server/ |
| | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/clustered-and-nonclustered-indexes-described?view=sql-server-ver16 |
|     |  Todo => http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/Blogs/3927/sql-clusterednonclustered-index-and-its-use.aspx  | 
| Q => | What is the relation b/w Clustered Index & Primary Key |
|  | By default, the clustered index sorts and stores the data based on PK. But if we need to create CI based on another column, we need to delete existing CI and then create CI based on that new column (because there can be only 1 CI) |
| | An index is like a tree of a set of nodes that are organized in a B-tree structure. ![610-image002](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c9485d9-1d1b-4516-9f71-e3a46e29521a) | 
| | When a query is issued against an indexed column, the query engine starts at the root node and navigates down through the intermediate nodes. The search continues down through the index nodes until it reaches the leaf node. |
| | A clustered index stores the actual data rows at the leaf level of the index. Returning to the example above, that would mean that the entire row of data associated with the primary key value of 123 would be stored in that leaf node. |

#### 1.2 Stored Procedures, VIEW (Virtual Tables) &  User-Defined Functions (UDF/Functions)

| | |
|-|-|
| VIEW (Virtual Tables) | * Any SELECT query given a name <br/>  * Takes NO I/P <br/>  * Can change data in tables |
| User-Defined Functions (UDF/Functions) |  * Used when we need to return scaler values out|of any sql function <br/> * Genrally used for temp calculations. <br/> *  Can take I/P <br/> * Only SELECT statements allowed so cannot make changes to data in tables<br/> * 
| Stored Procedures | * SQL Statements previously created & stored in DB.  <br/> * Can be invoked by remote/external programs e.g., C# code   <br/> * Takes I/P   <br/> *  Can change data in tables   <br/> *  Can have INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE   <br/> *  CAN NOT BE CALLED from WHERE/HAVING/SELECT |
| Triggers| Similar to S/P but S/P are manually invoked but triggers are called when an event occurs e.g., INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE on a table   <br/> *  Trigggers can invoke S/P|
| Stored Procedures VS </br> U/D Functions| * SP can modify table data while UDF cannot   <br/> *  SP cannot be called from INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE but UDF can be  <br/> * SP can have INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE & SELECT but UDF can only have SELECT|

#### 1.3  Improve performance of SQL Queries
| | |
|-|-|
| 1. | Find & Remove Unused Indexes         |
| 2. | Add missing indexes                  |
| -- |   ---------------------------------- | 
| 3. | Use SELECT COL'S instead of SELECT * | 
| 4. | Use TOP to filter results count      |
| -- |   ---------------------------------- | 
| 5. | Avoid too many joins                 |
| 6. | Minimize/Reduce large Write Joins    |
| -- |   ---------------------------------- | 
| 7. | Avoid SELECT DISTINCT                |
| 8. | Avoid Multiple OR                    |
| 9. | Run Queries during off peak hours    |

#### 1.4 Find unused indexes?
| | 
| - |
| Seeks, scans and lookups operators are used to access SQL Server indexes. |

#### 1.5 Dirty Reads / Isolation Levels / DISTRIBUTED CONCURRENCY Control
| | |
|-|-|
| REF | * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transaction-isolation-levels-dbms/  <br/> * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms-dirty-read-in-sql/ <br/> https://www.sqlshack.com/dirty-reads-and-the-read-uncommitted-isolation-level/ |
| --  |   ---------------------------------- | 
| DIRTY READ | A Dirty read is a situation when a transaction reads data that has not yet been committed. For example, Let’s say transaction 1 updates a row and leaves it uncommitted, meanwhile, Transaction 2 reads the updated row. If transaction 1 rolls back the change, transaction 2 will have read data that is considered never to have existed. |
| Common Concurrency problems | 1. dirty read  2. lost read 3. non-repeatable read 4.  phantom reads.  |
| 1. Dirty Read | Tx A reads X (data) which is being updated by Tx B not not commited. Later Tx-B rollback, so TX-A has dirty value of X (data) |
| 2. Non-Repeatable Read | TX-A reads data X multiple times and get its value different |
| 3. Phantom Read | Tx-A executes a query multiple times and rows returend/result are different |

#### 1.7 Diff ways to communicate from C#.NET to SQL DB - Stored Procedure vs EFCore vs Dapper
| From C#.NET, I can call MS SQL Server database either using stored procedures or using LINQ Queries on EntityFramework OR using DAPPER. When to use which way? |

#### 1.8 Misc. Interview Questions 
| | |
|-|-|
| How to handle if a query is not responding | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/database-engine/performance/troubleshoot-query-timeouts |
| | If the query doesn't return any data within the configured time-out value (typically 30 seconds), the application cancels the query and generates SqlException / Timeout expired | 
| | Troubleshooting -   </br> 1. Use Extended Events or SQL Trace  </br> 2. Execute and test the queries in SQLCMD or in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).   </br> 3. Increase timeout time   </br> 4. Split query into smaller parts |   
| Find 3rd Largest record | https://github.com/Raj-Kumar-Arora/SQL-LeetCode-Top_50_SQL/blob/main/README.md#47-second-highest-salary |
|  |  SELECT salary FROM employee ORDER BY SALARY DESC  </BR>   OFFSET 2 ROWS   FETCH NEXT 1 ROWS ONLY |
<details> 
  <summary>
   
   Query for SQL Server above is slightly difficult.  </br>
      EASY TO EXPLAIN SOLN ->  </br> SELECT salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC   LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;          //FETCH 1 Record after offset of 2 records from start </br>
       Shorthand for this =>          SELECT salary FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC   LIMIT 2, 1;        </br>    
                               --LIMIT => no of records to output / OFFSET => no of records to skip from top
